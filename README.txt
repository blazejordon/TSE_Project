We cannot understand how to get the dependancy S22.Lmap.dll
to work correctly. We have provided a link to the program
from a computer that the dependancy is connected on,
this program should work. If not the S22.lmap.dll will
need to be connected as a dependancy for the program.
We had issues that for some users it could not support this
file and after lots of researching we could not find a 
soultion. The program however can send email as shown in the
video.
